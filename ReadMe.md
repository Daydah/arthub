ArtHub
======
A hypothetical portal that creators (painters, artists, musicians etc) can showcase their artwork so fans can purchase them. Creators are charged only 2% by the portal as commission.

This application
----------------
A simple application about ArtHub that shows the following:

1. **Payment simulation**: The ability for the platform to collect payments on behalf of creators. I should be able to simulate a payment to a creator on the platform, as though I were one of the creator's fans (Transactions).
2. **Creator payout**: The ability for the platform to pay out creators. I should be able to receive a simulated payout from the platform, as though I were a creator on the platform (Transaction Split).
3. **Fee collection**: The ability for the platform to collect its fee from creators. I should be able to see the fees on simulated payments, as though I were an admin on the platform ().
